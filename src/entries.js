[h4]{Introduction}
[p]{Hey guys! It's been about three months since I posted anything here, and I felt like after worlds and my draft leagues had finished it was time to upload my moon and ultra series team report. After a strong Sun Series showing, my Moon and Ultra series results are not nearly as impressive. However, I still earned my worlds invite and worked hard to earn the best results I could at the tournaments I played, and had a lot of fun teambuilding for both formats. This article will go through all of the tournaments I played since the start of Moon series, through to Ultra Series and up to the Pokemon World Championships in Washington DC, which was held on the 16th to the 18th of September, 2019.}

[p]{This was my first moon series tournament of the year, and I honestly had very little idea of what I wanted to use. On the drive to the tournament, I decided to use the Zygarde Solgaleo core which was popular late in Sun Series for two reasons - It looked like a fun team that I could play defensively, and it was a team I was sure people wouldn't expect from me and prepare for. I had used nothing but Xerneas or a single Yveltal centric team up to this point un Sun Series, so I felt that I was safe to use a different archetype and not be counterteamed. I opted to use the fighting Z-Move on Solgaleo rather than Solganium at this point in the metagame as I wanted to test a bulky Solgaleo which could still OHKO Incineroar without needing a Life Orb or Expert Belt, and I felt that avoidng the attack and defense drop was a good justification for running Fightinium Z. I also opted to run Nature's Madness over Light Screen on Tapu Fini, as I preferred the chip pressure Tapu Fini would provide against my opponent's team. The only matchup I was concerned with was choice specs Kyogre + Lunala, which I had a feeling Graham (@AmedeeGraham) may use but he did not use the team at that tournament, and we did not face as he lost in Top 4. I did not drop a set all day with the team, however I dropped a game to a variant of Graham's Xerneas Groudon team in swiss and Lochlan Janke (@MudcrabV)'s Kyogre Yveltal team in finals. Overall I felt the team was extremely strong, and I absolutely loved playing it. It quickly became one of my favorite archetypes to play around with in Moon Series. The only change I really felt was necessary after the tournament was changing Venusaur to a more useful Pokemon, as I had teched it on for Groudon matchups and did not even find that I could bring it versus that core.}
