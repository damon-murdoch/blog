[p]{Hey everyone! It has been about six years since I last wrote about Pokemon, but I've decided with my return to VGC I'd like to get back into writing as well. This site is now completely hosted on my own Github, as I've lost much of my work over the years from third-party sites shutting down or deleting them and I'd like to preserve it myself in future.}
[p]{My old blog, [link]{Sir Scrubbington's Blog,https://sir-scrubbington.hatenablog.com} will be staying up for the forseeable future - However I will be migrating most of my old articles here over time. I'll be trying to keep everything as close to the original as possible, however I may fix minor formatting issues and typos as I see them. At the moment I'm planning on writing team reports, season writeups and potentially other projects moving forward.}
[p]{My first new article is about my regulation G Groudon team, which can be seen below.}

    "content": `
[p]{Hello everyone! My name is Damon, and I've been playing competitive Pokemon since 2015. I usually go by the name “SirScrubbington” or “Scrubbs” online, but on Pokemon Showdown I am known as “Jim's Esports”. I took a break from playing after Brisbane regionals 2024 due to burnout, but thanks to some of my friends I started to get back into playing late last year - towards the end of regulation H. I struggled to find a team I was comfortable with in that format, but with the return of the regulation G format from worlds last year I decided to pick one archetype and focus on it for the whole season.}
[p]{When I started building my team, the Chinese Sun team was picking up in popularity - so I decided to try working with Groudon as my restricted. I've used Groudon at many tournaments over the years, both Primal and Non-Primal - So it's a Pokemon I felt very comfortable using.}

[sh]{Groudon}
[mon]{groudon}
[code]{
Groudon @ Clear Amulet  
Ability: Drought  
Tera Type: Fire  
EVs: 252 HP / 156 Atk / 4 Def / 84 SpD / 12 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
- Protect  
- Bulk Up  
- Precipice Blades  
- Heat Crash
}
[p]{Groudon is the core of the team - Precipice Blades is incredibly strong (as long as it hits) and sun-boosted Heat Crash deals base-120 power damage against most targets - An OHKO on almost any weakness (Except Calyrex-Ice), and even many neutral targets. Clear Amulet is an incredible item on Groudon, as it nullifies Intimidate and Parting Shot on Incineroar - Which was extremely annoying for Groudon in previous restricted formats. Tera Fire was chosen to block Will-o-Wisp, as well as further buffing the damage of Heat Crash. It also helps defensively against Ice, Grass and Fire moves. I tested several moves in the Bulk-Up slot including Swords Dance, High Horsepower and Stone Edge - But Bulk Up provided the best value in most matchups, especially against Zamazenta and Calyrex-Ice.}
[sh]{Ogerpon-Hearthflame}
[mon]{ogerpon-hearthflame}
[code]{
Ogerpon-Hearthflame @ Hearthflame Mask  
Ability: Mold Breaker  
Tera Type: Fire  
EVs: 188 HP / 76 Atk / 52 Def / 4 SpD / 188 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
- Spiky Shield  
- Follow Me  
- Wood Hammer  
- Ivy Cudgel
}
[p]{I decided to pick Ogerpon-Hearthflame as the first partner for the team - due to the incredible synergy of Groudon's sun and Ogerpon's Tera Fire Ivy Cudgel. Sun-boosted Ivy Cudgel is able to deal incredible damage, even without much investment. I tested a few different speed tiers for this Pokemon - I started very slow with lots of bulk, then bumped up to outspeed Adamant Urshifu, then eventually ended up using Ceree's worlds spread which outspeeds Modest Landorus.}
[sh]{Flutter Mane}
[mon]{flutter-mane}
[code]{
Flutter Mane @ Booster Energy  
Ability: Protosynthesis  
Tera Type: Fairy  
EVs: 164 HP / 204 Def / 140 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Protect  
- Moonblast  
- Icy Wind  
- Taunt
}
[p]{Flutter Mane was the third Pokemon added to the team, as it has great synergy with Protosynthesis and Icy Wind for speed control. Tera Fairy Moonblast is also a fantastic offensive option and greatly helps with the Calyrex-Shadow matchup. Booster Energy was the item of choice, as it ensures we keep the speed boost even if sun is not active. While I opted to run 140 speed on the final team, some other possible speed stats are as follows:}
[p]{[b]{12 (172):} Can run 124 SpA and 4 SpD, gets the speed boost by 2 points and has much better offense but you will lose the speed mirror with almost all opposing Flutter Mane. }
[p]{[b]{84 (182):} Can run 52 SpA and 4 SpD, middle ground spread which outspeeds most Booster Energy Pokemon (Speed ties with 212+ Roaring Moon) and outspeeds Ceree's Miraidon without the speed boost by 1 point. Still gets the 2HKO on non-bulky Calyrex-Shadow with non-tera Moonblast.}
[p]{Overall, I think all three of these spreads are quite good - I had planned to use 84 speed at Brisbane regionals, but I recommend 140 speed as it is more reliable for Roaring Moon and other Booster Energy Pokemon.}
[sh]{Raging Bolt}
[mon]{raging-bolt}
[code]{
Raging Bolt @ Life Orb  
Ability: Protosynthesis  
Tera Type: Electric  
EVs: 148 HP / 36 Def / 100 SpA / 44 SpD / 180 Spe  
Modest Nature  
IVs: 20 Atk  
- Protect  
- Thunderbolt  
- Draco Meteor  
- Thunderclap
}
[p]{Raging Bolt makes a lot of sense on the team with Life Orb as it helps greatly with rain matchups, and can provide a Draco Meteor nuke in other matchups. It also functions as a lategame Miraidon answer, where you can pressure with Thunderclap after they Tera Fairy. I swapped between both Tera Fairy and Electric on Raging Bolt in different phases of the team - But overall I think Tera Electric is better for consistent damage as well as the OHKO on Fairy Miraidon with both sun and electric terrain active. However, Fairy can also be used as it helps against matchups such as Regidrago, Chien Pao and Draco-Locked Miraidon.}
[p]{I considered running a different item such as Magnet or even Assault Vest over the season, but I decided that the offense provided by Life Orb is too important as the team already has a lot of bulk-invested Pokemon.}
[sh]{Grimmsnarl}
[mon]{grimmsnarl}
[code]{
Grimmsnarl @ Light Clay  
Ability: Prankster  
Level: 53  
Tera Type: Ghost  
EVs: 236 HP / 156 Def / 116 SpD  
Calm Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Foul Play  
- Light Screen  
- Thunder Wave  
- Reflect 
}
[p]{Grimmsnarl is one of the most important Pokemon on this team - Even though it was added this late. It can be used in almost every matchup, especially against Miraidon and Calyrex teams where survivability is extremely important. Light screen allows Groudon to live a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Miraidon, and Reflect helps greatly in Zamazenta, Koraidon and Calyrex-Ice matchups. Both moves generally allow for your attackers to stick around longer and provide more value in each game. Foul Play is extremely useful for Calyrex matchups, non-Tera Calyrex-Shadow gets knocked out and Calyrex-Ice takes about 70-80%.}
[p]{Ghost makes sense as the tera type of choice as you can block Fake Out, however this is not worth it in most matchups - But the pressure makes it worth running anyway. If you'd rather run a defensive type, Poison may be worth considering. You can also consider running Spirit Break with a careful spread instead - this helps more against Terapagos, Kyogre and Urshifu matchups but is more vulnerable to Intimidate and Parting Shot. Scary Face was considered in the Thunder Wave slot, to help with the Landorus matchup - However, Thunder Wave gives Grimmsnarl a field presence which forces the opponent to actively target it, and not just focus on the partner slot.}
[sh]{Farigiraf}
[mon]{farigiraf}
[code]{
Farigiraf (F) @ Safety Goggles  
Ability: Armor Tail  
Tera Type: Water  
EVs: 220 HP / 172 Def / 4 SpA / 100 SpD / 12 Spe  
Bold Nature  
- Gravity  
- Trick Room  
- Foul Play  
- Psychic 
}
[p]{The last Pokemon added to the team - Farigiraf was a key member which allowed for a Trick Room + Gravity gameplan which is great for game two mixups or Trick Room-weak matchups. This gamemode was generally weaker than the standard gameplan as it is hard to bring both Grimmsnarl and Farigiraf in the same match, and you often lose your Ogerpon to get Trick Room set up. However, Precipice Blades spam under Trick Room is very difficult to switch into with Gravity, as this provides perfect accuracy and the ability to hit flying types. Aside from the hard Trick Room gameplan, Farigiraf was useful to provide mindgame pressure against Fake Out heavy teams, as well as to pressure Foul Play against Calyrex-Shadow and Calyrex-Ice.}

[h]{Conclusion}
[p]{I wasn't expecting much from the team at first, but I ended up really liking it - So I decided to work on developing and improving the team before Brisbane. The matchup into standard Koraidon, Miraidon and Shadow-Rider teams felt very strong, and most other restricteds were at least playable. Unfortunately, a lot of the meta developments later in regulation G made this team much harder to use - common threats such as Landorus-I, Calyrex-Ice and Pelipper cause massive problems for the team, especially when used together. Groudon also has the inherent issue of Precipice Blades having imperfect accuracy, so that along with Thunder Wave can lose games under the wrong circumstances.}
[p]{In the end, I was unable to use the team at regionals due to sickness - However I was able to get first, second and top four at different local tournaments during the season. I also reached 1600s in the best-of-one Showdown Ladder with the team, which has been pretty rare for me in previous formats. I'm unsure how well the team would have played into the metagame at Brisbane, but I worked hard on it and I'm really happy with how the team turned out.}
[p]{It was satisfying to work on one team for the whole season, but I did miss playing around with different teams - So I'm planning to try and find a balance between the two in the next format. I've been having a lot of fun with Zacian/Kyogre so far, but I'm also keeping my eye on Calyrex-Shadow/Zamazenta and Calyrex-Ice/Miraidon. Double-restricted formats generally allow for much more versatility than single-restricted, so I'm keen to see what teams become popular over the next few months.}
[p]{I really want to thank everyone in the Brisbane VGC community for making me feel welcome, a lot of things have changed over the years but we have always had an extremely friendly and strong local community. I also want to thank the Pokemon Showdown VGC room, I've met some amazing people in there and I've had a lot of fun playing in tournaments, for both old and new formats. I will not be travelling for regionals this year, but I may consider competing more seriously in the 2026 season - at the moment I'm happy to keep doing my best at locals, one event at a time.}
[p]{As far as writing goes, I'd love to go back to writing season reports like I did from 2016 to 2019 - So I'll definitely consider making a big event writeup once the 2025 season has finished. I will also consider writing about some of my older results over 2020 to 2023 if I have time.}

    "content": `
[p]{Hey guys! It's been about three months since I posted anything here, and I felt like after worlds and my draft leagues had finished it was time to upload my moon and ultra series team report. After a strong Sun Series showing, my Moon and Ultra series results are not nearly as impressive. However, I still earned my worlds invite and worked hard to earn the best results I could at the tournaments I played, and had a lot of fun teambuilding for both formats. This article will go through all of the tournaments I played since the start of Moon series, through to Ultra Series and up to the Pokemon World Championships in Washington DC, which was held on the 16th to the 18th of September, 2019.}

[mon]{zygarde-complete,solgaleo,incineroar,tapu-fini,toxicroak,venusaur}
[paste]{https://pokepast.es/17a7be476fee6db1}
[p]{This was my first moon series tournament of the year, and I honestly had very little idea of what I wanted to use. On the drive to the tournament, I decided to use the Zygarde Solgaleo core which was popular late in Sun Series for two reasons - It looked like a fun team that I could play defensively, and it was a team I was sure people wouldn't expect from me and prepare for. I had used nothing but Xerneas or a single Yveltal centric team up to this point un Sun Series, so I felt that I was safe to use a different archetype and not be counterteamed. I opted to use the fighting Z-Move on Solgaleo rather than Solganium at this point in the metagame as I wanted to test a bulky Solgaleo which could still OHKO Incineroar without needing a Life Orb or Expert Belt, and I felt that avoidng the attack and defense drop was a good justification for running Fightinium Z. I also opted to run Nature's Madness over Light Screen on Tapu Fini, as I preferred the chip pressure Tapu Fini would provide against my opponent's team. The only matchup I was concerned with was choice specs Kyogre + Lunala, which I had a feeling Graham may use but he did not use the team at that tournament, and we did not face as he lost in Top 4. I did not drop a set all day with the team, however I dropped a game to a variant of Graham's Xerneas Groudon team in swiss and Lochlan Janke's Kyogre Yveltal team in finals. Overall I felt the team was extremely strong, and I absolutely loved playing it. It quickly became one of my favorite archetypes to play around with in Moon Series. The only change I really felt was necessary after the tournament was changing Venusaur to a more useful Pokemon, as I had teched it on for Groudon matchups and did not even find that I could bring it versus that core.}

[paste]{https://pokepast.es/2be3779692129dcf}
[p]{After the last tournament I won with Zygarde, I felt like moving back to a more standard Lunala Xerneas team. This team was built on the same engine as the specs Koko Toxicroak team, but I adusted it to have a more defensive core in Assault Vest Tapu Koko and Amoonguss to offer redirection for my restricteds. Kommo-o was teched on as I saw it was getting used on quite a lot of Xerneas Lunala teams at the time, and liked its utility versus archetypes such as Yveltal Groudon or Yveltal Kyogre. It also allowed the team to automatically win versus any teams built around Dragon-Type restricteds such as Palkia. In theory, it helped with my Zygarde matchup as well however I was not able to break through Henry's Zygarde team, which was my singular loss in the entire tournament both in round two of swiss and in finals. Overall, I felt like this team was strong however I feel like it was a little bit rough around the edges in places and needed work before I would be comfortable using it at a major.}

[paste]{https://pokepast.es/6cd32737dda70379}
[p]{This was a very small tournament, and also the first time I tested one of my favorite Moon Series teams. I go into more detail about this team in a later section, where the team was improved upon for a later event however at this tournament I lost to Lachlan who beat me pretty convincingly in three games with a Mono-Steel team which was actually pretty hard for my core to break. In hindsight, I realised that there were gameplans I could have taken which allowed me to win vs. the team consistently however that is on me for not realising how to play the matchup in the moment.}

[mon]{yveltal,xerneas,incineroar,landorus-therian,amoonguss,tapu-fini}
[paste]{https://pokepast.es/fea2929019afa2b4}
[p]{I built this team after James Katsaros's performance at Oceania Internationals, where he made Top 4 with the exact same team but with Volcarona instead of Landorus. I chose to use Landorus-Therian for my tournament as I was worried about playing against Stakataka, and could not figure out how to break it with James' version of the team. I lost to Lochlan twice in this tournament, both in the last round of swiss and in finals in very close sets, however it was extremely difficult for me to win the matchup if luck favours him. Between both sets he did not miss a single grasswhistle despite never setting up gravity, however I believe in most situations he made the best play available to him and I respected that. This team felt very strong, and I really enjoyed piloting it. Yveltal and Xerneas in Sun and Moon series had extremely good synergy, with very few matchups that both of these Pokemon fail to handle and it is relatively easy to handle most of these threats (Such as Stakataka) with good supporting Pokemon such as Landorus. Incineroar, Tapu Fini and Amoonguss round out the team with a very strong defensive core which allow you to play safe and set up your gameplan consistently.}

[mon]{xerneas,kyogre,incineroar,toxicroak,smeargle,tornadus}
[paste]{https://pokepast.es/6cd32737dda70379}
[p]{My second time using this team at a live event, this team was originally built as a Psych-Up Kyogre team with Xerneas however after testing I found that the team was far better with just using Xerneas to set up early and then clicking Choice Scarf Water Spout to clean up threats. This team had a lot of options I really appreciated, however I feel that overall the trick room matchup was weaker than I may have liked. This was a much more aggressive, hard setup version of the Kyogre Xerneas core than the Amoonguss Kartana version, however I felt that having Smeargle and Toxicroak improved the mirror matchup as you had a redirection user which worked on grass types. Follow Me + Tailwind was also good versus faster Groudon teams, as you could then bring in Kyogre and click Role Play and this was essential for early Moon Series events in Brisbane. I ended up losing to Malcolm's Solgaleo Yveltal KokoChu team at this premier challenge, which I felt was a reasonably poor matchup but I could win if I played perfectly. I felt like this team was very strong for this time in the metagame, I felt comfortable piloting it and given the chance I most likely would have used it if I were able to attend the Oceania International Championships.}

[paste]{https://pokepast.es/42a8e658379fe783}
[p]{I was feeling a little bit of pressure going into this tournament, as I knew that if I were able to make at least finals I would achieve my first worlds invite since 2016. I really wanted to make worlds this year, so I was very determined to put on my best performance possible and clutch out my worlds invite. I decided to go back to the Zygarde Solgaleo core, as I hadn't used it for awhile and felt that people would mostly not prepare for it. This team was a more standard version of the team than my previous team, which featured Light Screen Tapu Fini and Solganium Z Solgaleo. I also switched out Venusaur for Firium Z Volcarona, which provided a means of redirection for the team and still performed Venusaur's role of cleaning up opposing Groudon. This team was extremely good, and I did not lose a single set the whole tournament against anyone but Graham, who 2-0'd me twice. The matchup vs. Graham's team was extremely difficult for me to play, and was almost unwinnable as my Volcarona was unable to live his Accelgor's Final Gambit. My one regret about teambuilding for this tournament is not ensuring Volcarona could take this hit, as it is possible with the right HP investment. Regardless, finals at this tournament was all I needed to achieve my second worlds invite, and I was very happy with the result!}

[p]{For my first Ultra Series tournament, we had a small 8-player tournament at Fastbreak Sports with a finals only top cut. I decided to use a team I had been experimenting with revolving around using the disruptive power of Incineroar, Amoonguss Fini and Manectric to support my two setup restricteds in Calm Mind Dusk Mane Ultra Necrozma and Xerneas. This team was relatively strong in most matchups I played, however I had no Ground resists so it was difficult to switch into Primal Groudon. I ended up losing in the second round to Graham at this event, as his Lunala Kyogre core was able to overwhelm my team as I did not have a form of speed control which was fast enough to overpower his and I was knocked out of contention for finals. This team was fun to play, however it had a lot of very glaring weaknesses so I decided to bench it for the moment after playing at this tournament.}

[p]{This was my second Ultra Series tournament, which I did not have too much time to prepare for so I decided to use a standard Groudon Xern Fini team. However, I decided to run Mega Kangaskhan as a secondary mega to better handle Lunala. Overall I felt the team handled itself relatively well, however I lost to both Graham and Paulo in swiss. Both teams were difficult matchups for me to play against, however if I made a few plays differently I could have won both of the game threes that I lost in these sets. Overall, I felt that I couldn't complain too much as I had lost both sets to my own mistakes and focused on trying to fix up the team and myself for the following premier challenge.}

[p]{This team was modified to go back to Payapa Amoonguss, as the previous team had Coba (and the only flying move I took was a banded dragon ascent, which it dropped to) and fixed the HP stat on my Tapu Fini so that it would activate the super sitrus berry on taking a Guardian of Alola Z-Move. I had much better luck with this version of the team, where I played the entire tournament losing only to Malcolm twice, both in the last round of swiss and in finals. I felt like my matchup to Mogar's team was unfavourable, however it was on me that I did not realise a lot of key information about the Pokemon on his team until it was already too late for me to capitalise on it.}

[p]{A little different from most of the teams I've used this year, I don't generally enjoy playing online tournaments but I though I would use this one to practise a little bit with an archetype I had seen picking up recently - Soft Perish Trap Groudon Fini Incineroar + secondary restricted. The original team I got the inspiration for my version from was Case Bongirne's Groudon Rayquaza variant, however I opted to use Yveltal as I felt that the team had an awkward Lunala matchup. I had a very good day one with the team, going 13-2 in sets however I started struggling to continue with a better than neutral win-loss in matches once I broke through to the mid 1600s, and I end my tournament run there. I felt that overall the team was very fun, however I think core always had glaring unfavourable matchups somewhere depending on the secondary restricted used (Xerneas, Rayquaza, Yveltal etc.) and this discouraged me from using the archetype further. I also felt that my version of the team was suboptimal, as I chose to use a Super Sitrus berrry on Amoonguss rather than the almost optimal Focus Sash item for this point in the metagame which would have greatly helped my Rayquaza matchup.}

[paste]{https://pokepast.es/8075bc929c5af63f}
[p]{For the last ever VGC tournament held at Fastbreak sports before it closed permanently, I decided I wanted to practise using a variant of Pado's Rayquaza Xerneas team which had not too long before won the European International Championship in Berlin, Germany. I opted to use Stakataka over the standard team's Nihilego as I felt it was a good Pokemon for handling the mirror matchup and I wanted to be able to handle trick room teams more effectively. I felt that Wide Guard was also a strong option offered to the team by Stakataka, and it also served as a Xerneas answer which is one of the main purposes of Nihilego on the standard build. In this tournament I lost to local player Teagan piloting a Kyogre Solgaleo team as she played very well to prevent me from breaking her Solgaleo, which I felt that this team struggled with greatly.}
[ssh]{Pokemon World Championships Preparation}
[p]{I had a reasonably long drought of events between my last premier challenge and worlds, so I went through a lot of different team iterations before deciding on what I wanted to use at the tournament. I'll go into each of those teams a little bit below, then over what I actually decided to use and my tournament run itself.}

[p]{The first team I built, I felt pretty comfortable using this team and really liked playing it however I didn't spend enough time practising with it before the tournament to feel confident piloting it at worlds. I decided to run Gengar on this team over the standard Nihilego as I wanted an answer to common pokemon such as Lunala, and felt that the team autolost to a well-played Solgaleo without it. Ghostium Z was my item of choice on Gengar as it was able to clean up both of these Pokemon and also offered a similar role to Nihilego in pressuring Xerneas with Sludge Bomb and somewhat Groudon with Destiny Bond.}

[p]{Heavily inspired by Graham's US Internationals finalist team, the next team I built was a Xernala team which used the offensive engine of Mega Medicham and physical Tapu Koko to break down the defenses of opposing teams. I was fully intending on using this team at worlds up until about a week and a half before the tournament, as early on in testing it was performing very well for me on ladder and I was winning most common matchups consistently. However, I felt the team really struggled with the Shedinja matchup as well as the Lunala mirror and as Lunala Rayquaza became a common archetype I felt that I could no longer rely on this team for worlds.}

[mon]{kyogre-primal,xerneas,kangaskhan-mega,incineroar,amoonguss,tornadus}
[p]{In the end, I decided on using Calvin's which he sent to me in the week before the tournament, after we discussed what we expected to be common at worlds and that my Lunala Xerneas team really just wasn't performing consistently enough for me to feel comfortable using it at worlds. Calvin had recently used this team to win two online Nintendo Switch invitational tournaments, and it met all of the requirements for a team I was comfortable using going into worlds - I just wanted to use a team which had Incineroar, Amoonguss and Xerneas as I felt I was best practised with those Pokemon and could play with them more consistently than any other core.}
[p]{I spent the week before the tournament practising with this team as much as possible, as well as interacting with the discord where I could to learn how to play the team before the world championships. When it came to the actual tournament, I had a really good start, beating a Japanese XernDon player and then winning against @Redo_VGC who was piloting Xerneas Yveltal Metagross. In round three, I played versus RedSilver who was piloting XernDon Torn Kang, which was a favourable matchup for the team however I got very unlucky in games one and three to lose the set. From then on, my luck didn't get a whole lot better where I lost to Zhengle Tu's Haze Light Screen Madness Tapu Fini on XernDon, which I was not able to break with the core and then Uncle Lou's Rayquaza Lunala team after missing a single target Origin Pulse on his Stakataka game three for the set. From then on I did my best to win out, as I did not want to drop from my first world championships and was chasing the x-3 run however I lost again to LunaDon and XernDon in rounds 5 and 9 respectively.}
[p]{I felt that Calvin's team was really good, and by no means regretted using it however I felt that after my initial loss, a lot of things which I couldn't control went against me to lose out of the tournament. It's always possible to look back and think that there were things I could have done differently to prevent it, and in this case there was at least one play I could have made which would have changed a game I lost. However, for the most part I felt that I played the best I could have given my circumstances in the tournament. For my first worlds, it was an eye-opening experience to the calibre of play I should come to expect from a high level tournament such as worlds, and showed me that I still have room to improve if I want to become a top level player.}

[paste]{https://pokepast.es/178a29593d1c0870}
[p]{For the open, after playing Day One I regretted registering for this tournament a little bit as I wanted to spend the day checking out the venue and hanging out with friends but I didn't want to waste my registration so I decided to sign up with a fun team I hadn't had the chance to use yet. I didn't stick in this tournament for very long, as my round one and round three matches were very unfavourable matchups which I were able to play to a game three scenario, where I choked the mindgames in the endgame and called the 50-50 wrong both times. This frustrated me immensely, as both sets had been very difficult and I had played well to get to that point and losing it all that way really bothered me. After this, I decided that it was better for me to just drop from the tournament and spend time hanging out with friends rather than keep worrying about it.}
[p]{Overall outside of my underwhelming tournament performances, the worlds run was amazing! I got to meet a lot of absolutely amazing people for the first time at the event, such as one of my close friends Nils Dunlop who I've known online and practised with for over three years now but never had the chance to meet in person. I had a lot of fun meeting people who I both had and hadn't interacted with before, and overall it was just an amazing experience! I didn't have too many expectations heading into the event, as it was my first time attending and I was really excited for a lot of the thing I hadn't experienced before such as the popup Pokemon Centre, and the Competitor Kit with both made me extremely happy.}
[h]{Conclusion}
[p]{I wasn't planning on returning to worlds next year if it was held in America again, as I was considering putting Pokemon aside for a bit to focus on other priorities. However, worlds in London has me really excited and I absolutely want to attend and compete again. This year was my first time travelling to America (Or outside of Asia Pacific, for that matter) and it was an amazing experience overall and I'd really love to experience Europe too. There are also a couple of European Pokemon players who I was unable to meet at worlds this year, who I'd love to meet next year!}
[p]{While this year definitely wasn't my best year for Pokemon after Sun Series, I'm really proud of how I've worked on improving my tournament mindset this year. I've been able to stop myself from tilting after losing a game in most situations, which has been a major issue for me in the past as I often felt that after losing a game I would lose confidence in my ability to take the set. This has become much less of an issue for me after really focusing on improving my attitude towards playing the game and the way losing affects me mentally. Overall, I think this has been a great year for my development as a player, and I don't regret any of it. Thankyou so much for reading this, and I really hope you enjoyed it!}

    "title": "SirScrubbington's VGC 2016 Format Report",
    "content": `
[h]{Foreword}
[p]{Hey all, I've recently discovered this report which I had almost written and published to my blog back in 2016 however it was forgotten and never uploaded. Unfortunately many pastebins have been lost in the past three years, so I've attempted to recover as many as possible without recreating them unauthentically. In additon to this, I've tried to more or less leave it as it was as it's an interesting reflection of my mindset as a player back when it was written. However, I've had to rewrite the regionals and nationals sections as they pointed towards a Nugget Bridge report I wrote using the blog system that is no longer accessible. Regardless, I hope you can find some interest in this report and I'd like it to be seen as a kind of time capsule for my development as a player in the later sections, potentially for the format itself.}
[h]{Introduction}
[p]{Hey guys! 2016 has been an incredibly big year for me as a Pokemon player, I've met a lot of amazing players at events, completely outperformed my expectations and I've honestly had a pretty fantastic time playing the 2016 format, which is something I would have never  expected to say during the first few months of the format. 2016 was my first full year playing VGC, as I started in around March of 2015 and was also my first year attending the National Championships in Melbourne - Which had really been a huge goal for me since I'd started playing. In this report I'll be going through my tournament season, as well as a few teams I made on the side which never got to see play at a tournament. Thanks for reading, and I hope you all enjoy the report!}
[h]{Early Season Testing}
[p]{The 2016 format was announced early on in November 2015, which gave me about 3 weeks to prepare teams before the Nuggetbridge Summer Scramble was announced. My first impression of this format was that Shadow Tag was really good, so I attempted to use Gothitelle to make a Dual Primal trick room team.}
[sh]{NB Summer Scramble (1-x)}
[mon]{kyogre-primal,groudon-primal,kangaskhan-mega,tornadus,gothitelle,ferrothorn}
[p]{My general gameplan was to use either Kyogre or Groudon depending on which primal my opponent was using, or both in certain matchups. I based the team off Scar's Team in the Battle of Legends, as I used the same 5 pokemon as him with Gothitelle over Cresselia. My version of the team was really awful, and I ended up doing really badly in the scramble but I feel this tournament and my performance helped me get used to the format and the kind of play required to be successful in 2016.}
[sh]{Aus VS. Malaysia Qualifier (0-1)}
[mon]{xerneas,kyogre-primal,salamence-mega,weavile,gothitelle,ferrothorn}
[p]{Looking back at this team, I see that Bronzong would have been a fantastic Pokemon choice over Gothitelle, but at the time I simply had Gothitelle because I wasn't sure what else I wanted and Bronzong hadn't really picked up in the metagame yet. It would have made the team better in so many matchups and I truly regret not trying it.}
[sh]{International Challenge January (Top 10 Australia)}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,kangaskhan-mega,salamence-mega,talonflame,smeargle}
[p]{After losing so easily I was pretty demoralised, so Luke Brown convinced me to try a more standard team with Scarfed smeargle and Quick Guard Talonflame. I ended up using this team in the International Challenge, and just barely made 10th in Australia. Early in the metagame these teams were decent, but more or less relied entirely on hitting dark void and getting good sleep turns to position yourself, which I considered to be very inconsistent and unreliable in the long run. I hated relying on that to win games so I changed this team pretty quickly after the tournament.}
[sh]{Nugget Bridge Major (4-5)}
[p]{Unfortunately it is impossible for me to retrieve my team and matchup combinations due to the Nugget Bridge forums deletion, I can give a basic rundown of the opponents I faced and how I fared in the tournament. For most of the tournament I used fairly standard Big Six variants, teching in new moves and Pokemon occasionally but for the most part my team remained the same each week.}
[ssh]{Round 1 - ReuvenVGC (win)}
[ssh]{Round 2 - CYGC (loss)}
[ssh]{Round 3 - KingWill53 (loss)}
[ssh]{Round 4 - davethebrave (loss)}
[ssh]{Round 5 - LithiumAcid (opponent drop)}
[ssh]{Round 6 - TheChaz (opponent drop)}
[ssh]{Round 7 - LPFanVGC (loss)}
[ssh]{Round 8 - HaxnandezTH (win)}
[ssh]{Round 9 - PephanVGC (loss)}
[p]{Finishing the Nugget Bridge Major with a negative record was a little bit demoralising, however it was only early on during the season and I can recognise that most of the opponents which I lost to were skilled players. Regardless of my performance, it was a good opportunity to learn more about the format and improve my skill level against international opponents.}
[sh]{Brisbane Premier Challenge #1 (2-3)}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,kangaskhan-mega,salamence-mega,talonflame,smeargle}
[p]{This was the first live event of the format for me, and I used a modified version of my international challenge team which dropped the scarf on smeargle for Sash, and I actually ran feint as a tech move for beating opposing smeargles. My justification for this was that feint + Brave Bird would be able to KO any opposing smeargles, although I found that Smeargle + Talonflame was a very passive lead against any team that did not lead smeargle themselves. I also used Flamethrower + Eruption special Groudon, which was good in some matchups but during the event I got paired against a Ho-Oh team piloted by Mastodon - Which fairly well destroyed me. He also managed to sheer cold my Geo'd Xerneas on the first attempt which did a pretty good job at tilting me going into the next round, where I lost to Boomguy's RayOgre team with Roar Zapdos after a double dark void miss.}
[sh]{Brisbane Premier Challenge #2 (Top 4)}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,kangaskhan-mega,salamence-mega,talonflame,smeargle}
[p]{This tournament I used practically the exact same team, as I'd been testing a lot of teams online but I wasn't really satisfied with any of them. The only massive difference I can remember between them was that in this tournament my Primal Groudon had rock slide - literally just because I didn't want to lose to Mastodon's Ho-Oh again. I made the horrible decision of using a special defence reducing nature, which made my Groudon get easily 2hkod by Salamence and realised the day after the event that Groudon actually got Ancient Power which I could have used instead. I also discovered a few weeks after the event that I wasn't actually running max happiness on my return Kangaskhan - I was starting to wonder why my return wasn't even strong enough to kill Talonflame at neutral. I lost in Top 4 to Boomguy, who was using a Cresselia Big 6 team which I really liked the look of and began testing with after the event.}
[sh]{Brisbane Premier Challenge #3 (Winner)}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,kangaskhan-mega,cresselia,talonflame,smeargle}
[p]{I had planned on bringing a RayOgre team to this tournament, but after testing and refining the Trick Room Big 6 Cresselia online, I found I really enjoyed using it and decided to bring it to the PC. The team proved really consistent in swiss, and I felt like I had answers for pretty much everything I faced during the day. I played against Luke Milligan (Pidgey) in the finals, who was one of my swiss losses but after careful consideration of my game plan I was able to take the finals set 2-0. This was also the first tournament where I met Malcolm (MogarVGC), a skilled VGC player who has become a good friend of mine since the event.}
[sh]{Brisbane Regionals (Top 8)}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,kangaskhan-mega,cresselia,talonflame,smeargle}
[p]{For this event, I don't think there was ever very much doubt in my mind that I was going to bring Cresselia Big 6. The team provided strong neutral matchups across the board, and having a trick room mode with slow Groudon ensured that I would have a playable matchup against other trick room primal teams.}
[p]{This was a best of one swiss regional with a best of three top cut, and I felt like this was of benefit to a less standard Xerneas Groudon team as my opponents may not have a specific gameplan. In this event I went 7-1 in swiss, which was absolutely necessary for me to top cut as I had the worst resistance of any other player in the top cut of that event. This is due to the fact that I lost my games extremely early, and my round one opponent dropped round two, forfieting to me after winning. This was not something I did not nor would ask for, and felt really uncomfortable about it for the rest of the event but I guess in the end, it determined me to play strong into top cut so to that much I am thankful for.}
[p]{I lost to Mitch Kendrick (@MitchVGC) in Top 8, as I didn't have a well defined gameplan against Kyogre Xerneas. Game one, I lead in such a way that allowed me to be susceptible to the Smeargle Xerneas flowchart, which was regrettable as I did not predict the lead as I should have. Game two I switched up my leads to provide a stronger matchup, and my Groudon win condition took a critical hit which cost me any chance of taking the match.}
[sh]{Australian Nationals (Top 8)}
[p]{Australian nationals was held the week after my first semester at University ended - So I was extremely busy with work and didn't really have any time to test new teams for the tournament as I would have liked to. Up until the night before the main event started, I had every intention of playing the tournament using a slightly modified version of my regionals team, with a more offensive, slower Xerneas EV spread and a few more optimised EV spreads elsewhere.}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,kangaskhan-mega,cresselia,talonflame,smeargle}
[p]{The Xerneas EV spread change was due to the general increase in bulk on opposing Xerneas in this point in the metagame, as my low investment and neutral nature on my regionals Xerneas meant that I was no longer picking up non-Geo'd Xerneas with Moonblast. When this became an issue, there was no way I could keep using my current spread. However, after testing this team on Battle Spot the night before the event, I was unsatisfied with my losses and felt that I was playing a number of teams which I was incapable of beating consistently, so I cut Cresselia for Salamence and switched to fast Groudon.}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,kangaskhan-mega,salamence-mega,talonflame,smeargle}
[paste]{https://pokepast.es/09cbe17944d7119a}
[p]{This is the standard, full Big Six team which I felt was experienced enough with to play most matchups and at least understand my win conditions, especially in a best of three set. The main problem with using a team like this at regionals or other smaller events in my mind was that it was easily understood by my opponents, and weak to being teched against in best of one. However, I felt that in a best of three scenario I could play around most techs as they are revealed and using a team with consistent neutral to favourable matchups was acceptable.}
[p]{I ended up going 7-2 in swiss at this national with my team, taking losses to Sam Hughes (@Sammy_Slug) in round four and Mitch Kendrick (@MitchVGC) in round six. Sam was using Rayquaza Kyogre Ferrothorn, which is a difficult matchup for my team and he outplayed me convincingly in game three, and Mitch Kendrick was using Xerneas Groudon Bronzong, and his Smeargle worked well to make the set difficult for me to play. Another memorable match I played this day was Bailey Owen (@BargensVGC) in round three, which was one of the toughest sets I played all day, against who was at the time one of the strongest VGC players in Melbourne. He outplayed me extremely convincingly game one, however I was able to make a comeback in game two. Game three was an extremely close game, which I was able to bring into a winnable position by making a number of extremely aggressive plays and winning a Groudon speed tie.}
[p]{This national was a two-day swiss event, where rounds eight and nine were played on day two, so going into day two with an x-2 record was probably one of the most nervewracking experiences of my life. However, on day two I was able to take wins against Jimmy Farrujia (@jfaybzplays) and Bailey Gabell (@BaileyGabell) who were both skilled players who forced me to play for my chances at top cut.}
[p]{Jimmy was playing an extremely interesting archetype in Xerneas Yveltal, which was something I did not have matchup experience with and lost game two pretty convincingly, however I was able to take game three with the team weaknesses I had learned in games one and two. Bailey Gabell was piloting Rayquaza Kyogre, which was a difficult matchup however it was a more standard variant than Sam Hughes' version so I had a better understanding of the matchup and won 2-0. After going x-2 early, I was very nervous that my resistance would not hold up enough to get me a top cut spot, however I was lucky enough to make the Top 16 cut at 13th!}
[p]{My top 16 opponent was Bailey Owen again, who was one of my most difficult games day one and I felt like his Crobat made the matchup a little bit unfavourable. After losing game one I made a punishable play in game two for which I was rewarded for with a critical hit and for him this was tilting enough for me to win game three without too much competition.}
[p]{In top 8 my opponent was Sam Pandelis, a well-known Australian VGC player and a multiple time Australian regional champion. Due to the unfavourable setup of the invite structure in 2016, the low number of events in Australia made it extremely difficult for Australians to achieve travel awards to the World Championships, even with numerous good regional placings. As a result of this, myself (and a number of other people) threw matches in top cut of this national to ensure that those of us that could would get their paid invites. It was quite difficult for the stream team to show games, as for example in top eight there was only one set which was actually played.}
[p]{This is something which for me was extremely dissapointing as it was an anticlimactic conclusion to one of my proudest achievements as a VGC player after a poor pre-season performance however the Top 4 placing was far more important to Sam than it was for me, as he needed it for his worlds invite and I had no chance of getting paid even with a win. Regardless of this, I was still very proud of my achievement and it felt amazing to make top cut at my first national and prove myself as a player in the Australian VGC scene.}
[sh]{Australian Pokemon League (3-1)}
[p]{The Australian Pokemon League, or APL was one of the best experiences which I could have asked for as an early Australian VGC player, and it's something which I really hope comes back for future formats. I think it's an extremely useful tool for introducing new players to high level competitive play, and providing an opportunity for players to learn the value of group teambuilding and discussion despite the nature of Pokemon as an inherently one-versus-one game in terms of offical competitive formats.}
[p]{I played almost every week for the Lumiose Mimes, which was an APL team captained by Phil Nguyen (@Aussie_Phil_N). At the start I was incredibly nervous, as I have trouble under pressure especially when there are more people than just myself relying on my results, which was something I was not used to I had an amazing team which I was happy to play for, and I think having the opportunity was a priceless experience for me. When playing in the APL, my matchups were as follows:}
[ssh]{Week 1: Didn't Play}
[p]{Unfortunately I had an assignment due this week which had to take priority over playing, but I promised Phil I'd play in the next week in whichever slot he preferred.}
[ssh]{Week 2: (VGC16') - Rhydian Cowley}
[p]{Me:}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,kangaskhan-mega,talonflame,cresselia,smeargle}
[p]{Rhydian:}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,kangaskhan-mega,gengar-mega,thundurus,smeargle}
[p]{This was actually a really fun set, and was our highlighted set for this week of the APL. Game one I was able to Smeargle Xerneas flowchart pretty safely, and game two I mixed up a little bit, however lategame I made a prediction based upon a move which Rhydian did not have so I ended up losing. Game three, I was able to get the fake out swords dance off freely, and through some faily shaky mindgames in the midsection I was able to close the game out with Groudon.}
[ssh]{Week 3: (VGC16') - Jay Tyrrel}
[p]{Me:}
[mon]{rayquaza-mega,kyogre-primal,gengar-mega,crobat,raichu,ferrothorn}
[p]{Jay:}
[mon]{groudon-primal,kyogre-primal,salamence-mega,gothitelle,raichu,ferrothorn}
[p]{This was the week after Australian nationals, and as we were playing against Bargens' team I felt pretty certain they were just going to counterteam big six. The strongest big six counterteams are generally dual primal teams, so I felt like they were just going to abuse that matchup. As a result of this, I put together a powerful Rayquaza Kyogre team which in theory has an extremely favourable dual primal matchup and through a little bit of luck in game two I was able to take this set 2-0.}
[ssh]{Week 4: (VGC15') - Sam Pandelis}
[p]{Me:}
[mon]{gardevoir-mega,landorus-therian,thundurus,heatran,amoonguss,azumarill}
[paste]{https://pokepast.es/8af4c252c5e24445}
[p]{Sam:}
[mon]{kangaskhan-mega,talonflame,zapdos,bisharp,breloom,swampert}
[p]{Sam is a good player, so this was an extremely stressful set to prepare for. I wasn't expecting him to counterteam me, as I wasn't particularly well known as a VGC15' player at this point in time so my tendency to use Gardevoir CHALK was most likely not known to him. On the other hand, I was expecting him to use a very offensive team so I had to prepare myself for the possibility of playing some pretty heavy mindgames. I got pretty heavily rolled over in game one, however in games two and three I was able to navigate through the onslaught of mindgames and take the set.}
[ssh]{Week 5: (VGC15') - Jerikho Bulandi}
[p]{Me:}
[mon]{charizard-mega-y,gengar-mega,landorus-therian,whimsicott,terrakion,milotic}
[p]{Jerikho:}
[mon]{kangaskhan-mega,landorus-therian,thundurus,heatran,amoonguss,sylveon}
[p]{I didn't know too much about Jerikho, however I knew that Dawg had spent a good amount of money drafting him onto his team so I wasn't underestimating him. I decided against using my Gardevoir team again, as the other games which had been played already that week were mostly played using counterteams - so I decided to use a more experimental archetype in Charizard Y Gengar Whimsicott. It never really had a big performance at live events, but it popped up a little in the late season as a powerful Japanese Battle Spot archetype so I decided to give it a shot, as it had a reasonable matchup to standard teams. Overall I felt like I got a little unlucky in the set, but Jerikho played really well with a strong team so he won 2-0 pretty safely.}
[sh]{BSPL}
[p]{The BSPL, or Battle Spot Premier League was another draft league I signed up for which was based around Generation five and six Battle Spot Formats - Including Battle Spot Doubles, otherwise known as VGC2015. This meant that a lot of VGC players wanting a break from the power-heavy format of VGC2016 signed up to have a chance to play for the doubles matches. I played for the Viridian Rhydons, which was a really fun team to play on which also featured my good friend, Brendan  Webb (@FloristTheBudew) as another doubles player. This league, while similar in structure was a very different experience for me than the APL, as I was placed on a team of Pokemon players from all over the world, all involved with different Pokemon formats - Including Battle Spot Singles, and even GBU Singles! It was a really great opportunity for me to play some really great matches, which were as follows.}
[ssh]{Week 1: Bailey Owen (@BargensVGC)}
[p]{Me:}
[mon]{salamence-mega,weavile,arcanine,aegislash,breloom,azumarill}

[p]{Bailey:}
[mon]{kangaskhan-mega,charizard-mega-y,landorus-therian,heatran,amoonguss,milotic}
[p]{As you've probably seen from elsewhere in this report, Bailey and I played quite a lot of times this year so I felt like he'd know me pretty well and decide to counter my standard Gardevour CHALK team. As a result of this, I was a little bit lost on which team choice to pick so I ended up going with a HyperOffense team which I built in mid 2015 after a practise set with Jack Buckley (@Arahpthos) renewed my confidence in it. My team had an extremely favourable matchup to his self-admitted Gardevoir counterteam, so I was able to win two fairly clean games, with game two being a little bit messier after a scald burn on his end and a high low kick roll on mine.}
[ssh]{Week 2: Kimo Nishimira (@TapuKimo)}

[p]{Kimo:}
[mon]{kangaskhan-mega,landorus-therian,thundurus,aegislash,amoonguss,azumarill}
[p]{After the success of the team last week, I decided I'd try using the same team this week as well. While I am more of a defensive player generally, as it allows you to make safer plays and still win I felt that this team allowed me to take games off highly skilled players if I were able to predict them accurately. However, Iost this set 2-0 from Kimo as he played extremely well, and despite the fact I was able to make the correct read and eliminate his Thundurus both times he was able to win the war of attrition and take both games.}
[ssh]{Week 3: Matame}
[p]{Me:}
[mon]{gardevoir-mega,landorus-therian,thundurus,heatran,amoonguss,azumarill}

[p]{Matame:}
[mon]{kangaskhan-mega,landorus-therian,thundurus,volcarona,amoonguss,milotic}
[p]{Playing hyper aggressively didn't pay off for me the previous week, so I decided to go back to my comfort zone and play with my Gardevoir CHALK team. He ended up using a fairly standard kangaskhan team, with a few interesting choices such as Milotic for the water slot, Volcarona over Heatran and then Aegislash over Cresselia. He played far more aggressively than I was prepared to deal with for my team, knocking out my Amoonguss on the switch-in turn one game one with Hidden Power Ice and Double-Edge and I didn't have the offensive pressure to deal with his team after that. Game two I wasn't able to keep things together and ended up losing, in what I think was at least a somewhat unfavourable matchup. However Matame played really well, and gave me a new appreciation to the skill of high level Smogon Doubles players.}
[ssh]{Week 4: MiltankMilk}
[p]{Me:}
[mon]{salamence-mega,excadrill,tyranitar,aegislash,amoonguss,azumarill}

[p]{Miltank:}
[mon]{charizard-mega-y,salamence-mega,landorus-therian,thundurus,cresselia,gengar}
[p]{After losing the last two weeks, I thought I'd experiment a little with a somewhat unusual team, based off a relatively standard but less common archetype. I kept the scarf Tyranitar set, but decided to use a mixed timid set with Ice Beam, Flamethrower and Dark Pulse in order to catch my opponent off guard and put pressure on intimidate switch-ins. My Salamence was bulky dragon dance to compliment this, and provided for a strong setup support combination with Azumarill and Amoonguss. With the right plays and a pretty favourable matchup, I was able to take this set in two games.}
[ssh]{Week 5: Didn't Play}
[p]{We were already out of contention of making playoffs, so we decided to let the people who hadn't had many opportunities to play have a chance this round. As a result of this, Pyritie and Quixxter took the Battle Spot Doubles slots this week.}
[sh]{Ladder Hero Meme Dream: Shedinja}
[p]{Outside of VGC tournaments and online competitions, one thing which myself, Jack Buckley (@Arahpthos) and Paulo Amedee (@Mastodon_Swoles) played around with on ladder quite a lot was a Shedinja team, which saw many variations over several months of playing.}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,salamence-mega,smeargle,shedinja,bronzong}
[paste]{https://pokepast.es/b917000715abfdf0}
[mon]{xerneas,groudon-primal,salamence-mega,smeargle,shedinja,amoonguss}
[paste]{https://pokepast.es/8262078f7a6e54cf}
[p]{The team abused the fact that in VGC2016, very few teams had any way to hit a soaked Shedinja so in many games you could simply lead Smeargle Xerneas, switch your Xerneas to Shedinja, click soak and call it a day. Of course, the game didn't always end there - Often you'd get to play out twenty to thirty turns of your opponents abusing you, but honestly that was at least a good part of the fun. The most variable slot on the team was the Amoonguss, which overwent a number of changes including Bronzong, Golduck and Mega Kangaskhan.}
[sh]{Additional Pastebins}
[p]{While many of my teams were lost, there are a number which I have been able to recover. They don't fit into any other section, so I'll be going into them a little bit here.}

[h]{Conclusion}
[p]{While my season started incredibly poorly, I think overall this was an extremely important format for my development as a player and helped me learn some key skills about playing video games competitively at any level - And this lead to my two breakout performances, at Brisbane regionals and Australian nationals. It was also the year where I got to meet a number of interstate and international friends for the first time, which has really helped me keep involved with the game since. Competition has only gotten harder since 2016, as the general player skill level has increased and the skill level of Australian top players has increased immensely. As the competiton improves, you have to improve as well and I think this has been an exciting time for Australian VGC and our standings as a country in terms of global player skill. In addition this, I feel very privileged to have been able to represent the Lumiose Mimes in the APL and the Virdian Rhydons for BSPL and both teams helped me improve immensely as a player, and tought me new things about Pokemon - VGC and otherwise. I hope you've enjoyed reading this report, and look forward to sharing more Pokemon content with you all!}
